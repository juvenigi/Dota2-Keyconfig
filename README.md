This is all you have to know. Well, let's do the same thing, but with shell scripts and __xbindkeys__!

The rest is left for cerimonial purposes, haha

# Dota 2 optimizations and key configuration

The aim of this project is to provide convenient keybinds to often irritating and repetative actions, ease up micromanagement,and to rearrange ability keys ergonomically (although not for everyone). However, Valve broke autoexec scripts, so I won't work with .cfg files anymore!

## Planned features

- Smart cast on key down disabled, range indicator enabled for easier executions of spells like Lina's Light Strike Array, Enigma's Black Hole,  etc..
- Abilites are bound to `A`, `S`, `D`, `W`, `E`, and ultimate is bound to `F`.
- Key chords. Rule of thumb: pressing 2 buttons is easier (and arguably more reliable) than double-tapping a singular one.
