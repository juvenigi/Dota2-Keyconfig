# Dota 2 optimizations and key configuration

This is now a twice rebooted project aimed at greatly amplifying effectiveness of Dota 2 players. It features a set of quality-of-life improvements for those who seek better keyboard shortcuts and convenient macros.

## Which features are planned and what's already implemented?

Good question. The whole project started as a variant of loopuleasa's Dota 2 configuration. Having used said layout I found that some things were simply uncomfortably placed for my liking. This is the goal of my _.cfg_ files: arguably better binds with minor but welcome additions.

## Distinct features of this config.

- Smart-cast is on by default. Smart-cast on release is implemented for skillshots/AoE ults where it is nice to see a range indicator.
- Abilites are bound to `A`, `S`, `D`, `W`, `E`, and ultimate is bound to `F`.
- Item hotkeys are `W`, `E`, `R`, `S`, `D`, `F`. Note that some of them are overlapping. That brings to the next point:
- Key chords and modes. A chord is a combination of keys pressed simultaneously and a mode is essentially the keybinds. One is defined by the other and everything is defined by the __Fundamental Mode__, which autoexec file executes at startup.


### Mode list:
- Fundamental
- Hero mode
  - no modifier pressed
  - alt pressed
  - space pressed
  - space + alt pressed (spalt)
- Courier mode
- Special hero mode
