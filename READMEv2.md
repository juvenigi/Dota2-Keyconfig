# What you're looking at?

A set of folders that don't have to necessarily be placed inside the Dota 2 config folder!

If you know how to create symlinks, just get one for __autoexec.cfg__ and __autoexec-files__ and you'll be good to go! As it turns out, Source engine can perfectly handle them, so why not to utilize them?

autoexec.cfg file is pretty empty, because the magic part happens in the autoexec-files files folder, where other `.cfg` files are at.

BTW, check out the etc folder, it contains good stuff, like sound file names which you can easily include in your own configuration file!
